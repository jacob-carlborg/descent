This document explains the signature of types in Descent.

Most types have the same signature as in DMD. However, if types are not resolved,
like in the case of A.B, where A.B is not resolved, or typeof(A), where A may
be an alias template parameter, the signature is the following:

  ?fqn --> unresolved
  *exp --> typeof

Also, to make reference to an enum member, alias, typdef, variable 
or enum member in the source code, that is a top level declaration, 
the signature is the same for types, but the initial character
is Q, i.e.:

  Q4test1foo     --> variable, foo in module test.
  Q4test3Foo3foo --> foo enum member, ailas, typedef, variable or enum memeber
                     in module test, declaration Foo
                     
For functions, the prefix is O, and immediately after the fully qualified
name, comes the real function signature: the signature of the parameters,
followed by X, Y or Z (TODO: find out what is this) and the signature of the
return type. For example:

  Q4test1fooFiZc --> function foo in module test, taking and int and returning
                     a char

For local variables, it's the signature of the containing function followed
by #, numbers and the name of the variable. For example:

  Q4test1fooFiZc#x   --> variable x declared in the above function
  Q4test1fooFiZc#0#x --> variable x declared in the first scope block of the 
                         above function
