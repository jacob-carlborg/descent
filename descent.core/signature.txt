This document explains the signature of types in Descent.

Most types have the same signature as in DMD. However, if types are not resolved,
like in the case of A.B, where A.B is not resolved, or typeof(A), where A may
be an alias template parameter, the signature is the following:

  ?fqn --> unresolved
  *exp --> typeof

Also, to make reference to an alias, typdef or variable in the source
field, that is a top level declaration or a field of a class, interface,
etc, the signature is the same for types, but the initial character
is Q, i.e.:

  Q4test1foo --> variable foo in module test.
