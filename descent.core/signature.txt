This document explains the signature of types in Descent.

Most types have the same signature as in DMD. However, if types are not resolved,
like in the case of A.B, where A.B is not resolved, or typeof(A), where A may
be an alias template parameter, the signature is the following:

  ?fqn --> unresolved
  *exp --> typeof

Also, to make reference to an enum member, alias, typdef, variable 
or enum member in the source code, that is a top level declaration, 
the signature is the same for types, but the initial character
is Q, i.e.:

  Q4test1foo     --> variable, foo in module test.
  Q4test3Foo3foo --> foo enum member, ailas, typedef, variable or enum memeber
                     in module test, declaration Foo
