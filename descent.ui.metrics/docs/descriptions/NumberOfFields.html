		<h1>Number Of Fields</h1>
		<p>This metric represents the number of fields in a method. Although a large number of fields is not necessarily an indication of bad code, it does 
			suggest the possibility of grouping fields together and extracting classes. This gives the group of fields with their associated operations a name 
			thus improving the semantics of the object model.</p>
