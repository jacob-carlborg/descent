		<h1>Lack of Cohesion in Methods</h1>
		<p>Cohesion is an important concept in OO programming. It indicates whether a class represents a single abstraction or multiple
			abstractions. The idea is that if a class represents more than one abstraction, it should be refactored into more than one class,
			each of which represents a single abstraction.</p>
		<p>Despite its importance, it is difficult to establish a clear mechanism for measuring it. This is probably due to the fact that good
			abstractions have deep semantics and a class that is clearly cohesive when viewed from a semantic point of view may not be so when
			viewed from a purely symbolic point of view.</p>
		<p>As an aside, the somewhat inelegant name is due to the wish to have lower metric values representing a 'better' situation.</p>
		<p>I have selected three definitions of lack of cohesion. That of Chidamber and Kemerer, that of Henderson and Sellers, and one I
			invented myself.</p>
		<h2>Chidamber and Kemerer</h2>
		<p>Chidamber and Kemerer define Lack of Cohesion in Methods as the number of pairs of methods in a class that don't have at least one
			field in common minus the number of pairs of methods in the class that do share at least one field. When this value is negative, the
			metric value is set to 0.</p>
		<h2>Henderson-Sellers</h2>
		<p>Henderson-Sellers defines Lack of Cohesion in Methods as follows. Let:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td> <b>M</b>
					</td>
					<td>be the set of methods defined by the class</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> <b>F</b>
					</td>
					<td>be the set of fields defined by the class</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> <i><font face="Symbol">r</font>(f)</i>
					</td>
					<td>be the number of methods that access field <i>f</i>, where <i>f</i> is a member of <b>F</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> <i>&lt;<font face="Symbol">r</font>&gt;</i>
					</td>
					<td>be the mean of <i><font face="Symbol">r</font>(f)</i> over <b>F</b>.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Then:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2">Lack of Cohesion in Methods</td>
					<td rowspan="2">=</td>
					<td align="center"> <u><i>&lt;<font face="Symbol">r</font>&gt;</i> - |<b>M</b>|</u>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td align="center">1 - |<b>M</b>|</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</blockquote>
		<hr/>
		<p><b>Note 1:</b> I have only included methods in <b>M</b> if they access at least one field. The reason for this is that methods that
			do not access fields are often required to be non-static for reasons of polymorphic dispatch. However, these kinds of methods
			skew the value of this metric in a way that is not helpful. </p>
		<p><b>Note 2:</b> I have only included fields in <b>F</b> if they are accessed by at least one method in the class. A good compiler can
			tell you if fields are unused, and leaving them in the calculation of this metric skews the value.</p>
