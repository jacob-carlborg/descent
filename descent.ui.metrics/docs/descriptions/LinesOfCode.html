		<h1>Lines of Code in Method</h1>
		<p>This measure indicates the number of lines a method occupies - a line is determined by the presence of a newline character. It is a very basic 
			measure of size and is susceptible to variation purely on the basis of different formatting styles. However, many users of the <a 
			href="../index.html">Metrics Plugin</a> asked for it's inclusion, so here it is.</p>
		<p>Setting aside the obvious difficulties with differences produced by different formatting styles, Lines of Code counts also suffer from problems in 
			definition due to lines of whitespace, comment lines, etc (i.e. should these be counted or not). This implementation includes all of these things 
			in the measure. For an alternative that does not suffer from these problems, see the <a href="NumberOfStatements.html">Number of Statements</a> 
			metric.</p>
		<p>Those interested in the productivity of a development team are advised to avoid any measure based on code size, and should instead focus on the rate 
			of delivery of completed features using appropriate incremental and evolutionary techniques.</p>
