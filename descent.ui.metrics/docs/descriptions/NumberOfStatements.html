		<h1>Number Of Statements</h1>
		<p>This metric represents the number of statements in a method. I consider it a more robust measure than Lines of Code since the latter is fragile with 
			respect to different formatting conventions. However, as in the case of Lines of Code, a large number of statements is not in itself a bad thing, 
			it does suggest the possibility of extracting methods which gives related groups of statements a name and therefore increases the level of 
			abstraction and deepens semantics.</p>
		<p>Statements counted by this metric are: break, continue, do, explicit constructor call, explicit super constructor call, for, if, return, switch, 
			throw, try, catch, finally, while, assignments. method calls, pre/post increment/decrement. In addition, local class definitions will cause the 
			enclosing method's statement count to be increased by the total statement count of the local class.</p>
