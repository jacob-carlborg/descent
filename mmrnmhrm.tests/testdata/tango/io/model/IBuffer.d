/*******************************************************************************

        The premise behind this IO package is as follows:

        A central concept is that of a buffer. Each buffer acts
        as a queue (line) where items are removed from the front
        and new items are added to the back. Buffers are modeled 
        by tango.io.model.IBuffer, and a concrete implementation 
        is provided by this class.
        
        Buffers can be read and written directly, but Readers, 
        Iterators, and/or Writers are often leveraged to apply 
        structure to what might otherwise be simple raw data. 

        Readers & writers are bound to a buffer; often the same 
        buffer. It's also perfectly legitimate to bind multiple 
        readers to the same buffer; they will access buffer 
        content serially as one would expect. This also applies to
        multiple writers on the same buffer. Readers and writers
        support three styles of IO: put/get, the C++ style << &
        >> operators, and the () whisper style. All operations 
        can be chained.
        
        Any class can be made compatable with the reader/writer
        framework by implementing the IReadable and/or IWritable 
        interfaces. Each of these specify just a single method.
        Once compatable, the class can simply be passed to the 
        reader/writer as if it were native data. Structs can be
        made compatible in a similar manner by exposing an
        appropriate function signature.
        
        Buffers may also be tokenized by applying an Iterator. 
        This can be handy when one is dealing with text input, 
        and/or the content suits a more fluid format than most 
        typical readers & writers support. Iterator tokens
        are mapped directly onto buffer content (sliced), making 
        them quite efficient in practice. Like Readers, multiple
        iterators can be mapped onto a common buffer; access is
        serialized in a similar fashion.

        Conduits provide virtualized access to external content,
        and represent things like files or Internet connections.
        They host both an input and output stream. Conduits are
        modelled by tango.io.model.IConduit, and implemented via
        classes FileConduit, SocketConduit, ConsoleConduit, and 
        so on. Additional conduit varieties are easy to construct: 
        one either subclasses tango.io.Conduit, or implements 
        tango.io.model.IConduit ~ depending upon which is the most 
        convenient to use. Each conduit reads and writes from/to 
        a buffer in big chunks (typically the entire buffer).

        Conduits may have one or more filters attached. These 
        will process content as it flows back and forth across
        the conduit. Examples of filters include compression, utf
        transcoding, and endian transformation. These filters
        apply to the entire scope of the conduit, rather than
        being specific to one data-type or another. Specific 
        data-type transformations are applied by readers and 
        writers instead, and include operations such as 
        endian-conversion.

        Buffers are sometimes memory-only, in which case there
        is nothing left to do when a reader (or iterator) hits
        end of buffer conditions. Other buffers are themselves 
        bound to a Conduit. When this is the case, a reader will 
        eventually cause the buffer to reload via its associated 
        conduit. Previous buffer content will thus be lost. The
        same approach is applied to writers, whereby they flush 
        the content of a full buffer to a bound conduit before 
        continuing. Another variation is that of a memory-mapped
        buffer, whereby the buffer content is mapped directly to
        virtual memory exposed via the OS. This can be used to 
        address large files as an array of content.

        Readers & writers may have a protocol attached. The role
        of a protocol is to format (and parse) data according to
        the specific protocol, and there are both binary and text
        oriented protocol to select from. 

        Direct buffer manipulation typically involves appending, 
        as in the following example:
        ---
        // create a small buffer
        auto buf = new Buffer (256);

        auto foo = "to write some D";

        // append some text directly to it
        buf.append("now is the time for all good men ").append(foo);
        ---

        Alternatively, one might use a Writer to append the buffer. 
        This is an example of the 'whisper' style supported by the
        IO package:
        ---
        auto write = new Writer (new Buffer(256));
        write ("now is the time for all good men "c) (foo);
        ---

        One might use a GrowBuffer instead, where one wishes to append
        beyond the specified size. 
        
        A common usage of a buffer is in conjunction with a conduit, 
        such as FileConduit. Each conduit exposes a preferred-size for 
        its associated buffers, utilized during buffer construction:
        ---
        auto file = new FileConduit ("file.name");
        auto buf = new Buffer (file);
        ---

        However, this is typically hidden by higher level constructors 
        such as those of Reader and Writer derivitives. For example:
        ---
        auto file = new FileConduit ("file.name");
        auto read = new Reader (file);
        ---

        There is indeed a buffer between the Reader and Conduit, but 
        explicit construction is unecessary in common cases. See both 
        Reader and Writer for examples of formatted IO.

        Stdout is a more specialized converter, attached to a conduit
        representing the console. However, all conduit operations are
        legitimate on Stdout and Stderr. For example:
        ---
        Stdout.conduit.copy (new FileConduit ("readme.txt"));
        ---

        Stdout also has support for both text conversions and formatted 
        output:
        ---
        Stdout ("now is the time for ") (3) (" good men ") (foo);

        Stdout.format ("now is the time for {} good men {}", 3, foo);
        ---

        Stdout is attached to a specific buffer, which in turn is attached 
        to a specific conduit. This buffer is known as Cout, and is attached 
        to a conduit representing the console. Cout can be used directly, 
        bypassing the Stdout formatting layer if so desired (it is lightweight)
        
        Cout has relatives named Cerr and Cin, which are attached to 
        the corresponding console conduits. Writer Stderr, and reader 
        Stdin are mapped onto Cerr and Cin respectively, ensuring 
        console IO is buffered in one common area. 
        ---
        Cout ("what is your name?") ();
        Cout ("hello ")(Cin.get).newline;
        ---

        An Iterator is constructed in a similar manner to a Reader; you
        provide it with a buffer or a conduit. There's a variety of 
        iterators available in the tango.text package, and they are each
        templated for utf8, utf16, and utf32 ~ this example uses a line 
        iterator to sweep a text file:
        ---
        auto file = new FileConduit ("file.name");
        foreach (line; new LineIterator (file))
                 Cout(line).newline;
        ---                 

        Buffers are useful for many purposes within Tango, but there
        are times when it may be more appropriate to sidestep them. For 
        such cases, conduit derivatives (such as FileConduit) support 
        direct array-based IO via a pair of read() and write() methods. 
        These alternate methods are accessed via the conduit input and 
        output streams, and will also invoke any attached filters.
