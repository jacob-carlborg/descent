/**
 * The SelectionKey class holds the information concerning the conduits and
 * their association to a selector. Each key keeps a reference to a registered
 * conduit and the events that are to be tracked for it. The 'events' member
 * of the key can take two meanings, depending on where it's used. If used
 * with the registration methods of the selector (register(), reregister()) it
 * represents the events we want to track; if used within a foreach cycle
 * on an ISelectionSet it represents the events that have been detected for a
 * conduit.
 *
 * The SelectionKey can also hold an optional object via the 'attachment'
 * member. This member is very convenient to keep application-specific data
 * that will be needed when the tracked events are triggered.
 *

/**
 * A selector is a multiplexor for I/O events associated to a Conduit.
 * All selectors must implement this interface.
 *
 * A selector needs to be initialized by calling the open() method to pass
 * it the initial amount of conduits that it will handle and the maximum
 * amount of events that will be returned per call to select(). In both cases,
 * these values are only hints and may not even be used by the specific
 * ISelector implementation you choose to use, so you cannot make any
 * assumptions regarding what results from the call to select() (i.e. you
 * may receive more or less events per call to select() than what was passed
 * in the 'maxEvents' argument. The amount of conduits that the selector can
 * manage will be incremented dynamically if necessary.
 *
 * To add, modify or remove conduit registrations to the selector you use
 * the register(), reregister() and unregister() methods respectively.
 *
 * To wait for events from the conduits you need to call any of the select()
 * methods. The selector cannot be modified from another thread while
 * blocking on a call to these methods.
 *
 * Once the selector is no longer used you must call the close() method so
 * that the selector can free any resources it may have allocated in the call
 * to open().

 * import tango.io.selector.model.ISelector;

 * // will receive 2 events per invocation to the select() method.
