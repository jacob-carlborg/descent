/**
 * Represents an entry on a runtime classpath. A runtime classpath entry
 * may refer to one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>A Java project (type <code>PROJECT</code>) - a project entry refers
 * 		to all of the built classes in a project, and resolves to the output
 * 		location(s) of the associated Java project.</li>
 * 	<li>An archive (type <code>ARCHIVE</code>) - an archive refers to a jar, zip, or
 * 		folder in the workspace or in the local file system containing class
 * 		files. An archive may have attached source.</li>
 * 	<li>A variable (type <code>VARIABLE</code>) - a variable refers to a 
 * 		classpath variable, which may refer to a jar.</li>
 * 	<li>A library (type <code>CONTAINER</code>) - a container refers to classpath
 * 		container variable which refers to a collection of archives derived
 * 		dynamically, on a per project basis.</li>
 *  <li>A contributed classpath entry (type <code>OTHER</code>) - a contributed
 *      classpath entry is an extension contributed by a plug-in. The resolution
 *      of a contributed classpath entry is client defined. See
 * 		<code>IRuntimeClasspathEntry2</code>.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface for contributed a classpath entry
 * types (i.e. type <code>OTHER</code>). Note, contributed classpath entries
 * are new in 3.0, and are only intended to be contributed by the Java debugger.
